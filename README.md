A One Piece themed adventure game where you play as Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to become the Pirate King!

# Leveraging Amazon Q CLI for Game Development

During the development of Luffy's Grand Adventure, I utilized Amazon Q CLI, an AI-powered coding assistant that integrates seamlessly into the command-line interface. This tool significantly streamlined the development process by providing real-time code suggestions, generating boilerplate code, and assisting with debugging tasksâ€”all through natural language prompts. For instance, when implementing Luffy's stretching mechanics or designing boss battle behaviors, Amazon Q CLI offered valuable code snippets and guidance, reducing development time and enhancing code quality. Its ability to understand the context of my project and provide tailored assistance made it an indispensable tool in bringing the world of One Piece to life through this game.
